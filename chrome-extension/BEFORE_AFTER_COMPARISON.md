     • New content appears
     • You scroll
     • Tab regains focus
```

#### 4. **Contextual Alerts**
```
❌ Old: Generic results in popup
✅ New: Smart alerts only when needed
     • Big alert if fake found
     • Subtle "all clear" if clean
     • Badge for quick status
```

#### 5. **Non-Intrusive**
```
❌ Old: Requires your attention
✅ New: Works silently, alerts when needed
     • 30-second cooldown
