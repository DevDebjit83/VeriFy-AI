## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Integrate into App.tsx

You need to add the Settings page route to your App.tsx. Open `APP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

**Quick version:**

1. Make sure your imports are correct (already done):
```typescript
import { HeaderEnhanced } from './components/HeaderEnhanced';
import { AnalyzePage } from './components/AnalyzePageEnhanced';
import { SettingsPage } from './components/SettingsPage';
```

2. Add 'Settings' to your Page type:
```typescript
type Page = 'Home' | 'Analyze' | 'Trending' | 'Community' | 'About' | 'Profile' | 'Settings';
```

3. Add the Settings route after Profile:
```typescript
        {currentPage === 'Settings' && (
          <motion.div key="settings" initial="initial" animate="in" exit="out" variants={pageVariants} transition={pageTransition}>
            <SettingsPage />
          </motion.div>
        )}
```

### Step 2: Restart Frontend

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Everything!

1. **Login** to your account
2. **Notice the avatar** appears instead of the login button! 🎉
3. **Click the avatar** - dropdown menu appears
4. **Click Settings** - opens avatar customization page
5. **Choose an avatar** (upload, emoji, or gradient)
6. **Save** and refresh - your avatar persists!
7. **Go to Analyze page**
8. **Try dragging a file** - works perfectly!
9. **Analyze something** - appears in history sidebar
10. **Delete a history item** - confirmation dialog appears
11. **Click Logout** in avatar menu - logs you out

## 🎨 Feature Highlights

### Avatar System Colors

The gradient avatars use 8 beautiful color schemes:
- Ocean (Indigo to Purple)
- Sunset (Orange to Pink)
- Forest (Green to Teal)
- Fire (Red to Amber)
- Sky (Blue to Cyan)
- Purple (Purple to Fuchsia)
- Rose (Rose to Pink)
- Emerald (Emerald to Green)

### History Data Format

History is stored in localStorage with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "type": "text",
  "content": "First 100 characters of content...",
  "result": {
    "verdict": "fake",
    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  "timestamp": 1234567890000
}
```

### File Upload Validation

The system validates:
- **File type** - Must match the active tab (image/video/audio)
- **File size** - Maximum limits per type
- **Format** - Only specific formats allowed per type
